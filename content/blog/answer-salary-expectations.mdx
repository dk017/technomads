One of the most challenging moments in any job interview comes when the interviewer asks, "What are your salary expectations?" This question can make even experienced professionals uncomfortable, as it requires balancing self-worth with market reality while maintaining negotiating power.

This guide will help you navigate this crucial conversation with confidence and professionalism.

## Why Interviewers Ask About Salary Expectations

Understanding the interviewer's perspective helps frame your response effectively:

- **Budget Alignment**: They need to ensure candidates fit within their range
- **Negotiation Assessment**: They evaluate your professional communication skills

## Preparation: Essential Research

Before entering any salary discussion, arm yourself with data:

- **Industry Standards**: Research salary ranges for your role and location

## Strategic Response Approaches
